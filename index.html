<p>Make a list of everyone you need to thank. If your thank-yous are the result of
a party in your honor, <strong>write down the <u>names</u> of those who sent or
brought a gift</strong>, whether it came by mail, email, carrier pigeon or in person.
Then add in the friends who did anything to help out with the get-together—planning,
decorating, running errands and so on.</p>
