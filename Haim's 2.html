<p>
  1. Greeting. Don’t forget to make sure you’re using the correct form and spelling of the person’s name, as well as anyone else’s mentioned in the note.

  Dear Aunt Sharon and Uncle Bob,


  2. Express your thanks. Begin with the two most important words: Thank you.

  Thank you so much for…
  It made my day when I opened…
  I’m so grateful you were there when…


  3. Add specific details. Tell them how you plan to use or display their gift. It shows them that you really appreciate the thought that went into it. Even if it’s cold hard cash, describe how you’ll spend the stuff.

  Here’s a picture of me with my new briefcase. I look so professional!
  I can’t wait to use the birthday money you sent to decorate my dorm room.
  The going-away party meant so much to me. Having all my friends and family in one place was something I’ll never forget.


  4. Look ahead. Mention the next time you might see them, or just let them know you’re thinking of them.
  
  We look forward to seeing you next month at Lucy’s party.


  5. Restate your thanks. Add details to thank them in a different way.

  Again, thank you for your generosity. I’m so excited about college. I’ll let you know all about it when I get settled.
  We felt so blessed that you made the trip to be with us on our wedding day. We can’t wait to see you again soon!


  6. End with your regards. “Sincerely” is a safe standby, but for closer relationships, you might choose a warmer option.

  With love,
  Many thanks,
  Yours truly,
</p>
